# Resolute
A fitness tracking/logging application with social media aspects. The purpose of such an application is to encourage users and their friends to be involved in each other's fitness endeavors through non-intrusive mobile notifications.

The primary function of Resolute is to remind users to be physically active via notifications. These can come from the app itself, but will also come from other users such as contacts or friends. When a user completes a workout it will notify their contacts with a push-notification from Resolute of their achievement. The friend is prompted for a one-button auto-reply such as “Great work!” or “Impressive!”. This subtly encourages the user's friends to exercise alongside them, while adding motivation for the original user to keep at their exercises without requiring any more input besides logging their workout.

I am a junior at EMU double majoring in Data Science and Political Science with plans to graduate in the winter of 2025. My career goal is to become a political analyist for an interest group or news network. My coding experience has all been through Eastern, so I have knowledge primarily in Java and Python. In my free time I enjoy reading, going to concerts, and hanging out with my cat.
